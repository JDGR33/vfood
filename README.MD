# Food prices scraping for Venezuela

# Description

The aim of the project is to create a python scripts that scrapes food prices from the top supermarkets of Caracas, Venezuela and safe the data in a DataBase.

I am currently running a .bat file with Task Scheduler on my Windows PC for testing the automation. Also, the database is in a local host. 

In the future, I will deploy this project in a Linux server that will run the automation in a cron job and will host the Data Base.

If you want to run this automation yourself, you will need to create your own .bat to run the automation and your own .env with your Postgres credentials. Feel free to email me for help.

# Usage
You will need to execute the script to update de Data Base.


# Roadmap
* create a database to safe the price of the dollar

# Ideas for the future:
    * Use Twitter api to get other exchange rates.
# Contribution 
I am not ready to accept contributions at the moment.
